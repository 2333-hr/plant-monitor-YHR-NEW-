Some important notes in advance:
I've created a library before, but because it's all uploaded in the form of folders, I feel that the presentation form is not intuitive and I want to rebuild some architecture, so I simply build a new library. 
Here are some pictures of the proof:

Now let's get started with a note about my library! Hope to help others have a better understand of the content of the files in my Github repository and its related features!
